        <h1>The Game of Life</h1>
        <p>
          A cellular automaton designed by the mathematician John Horton Conway
          in 1970.
        </p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by
            underpopulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
            generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
            overpopulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live
            cell, as if by reproduction.
          </li>
        </ol>
